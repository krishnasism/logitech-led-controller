# Logitech LED Controller
A simple controller that changes the LED colour of a Logitech device that supports RGB.

This project was made to control my Logitech G102, but I think that this may work with any device that supports RGB.

## Running
Simply clone the repository and browse to the folder.
```
python bgled.py
```

## Download - LED ILLUMINATION SDK
If you want to develop something like this yourself with Python, Java, C# etc.., Logitech provides and SDK for development.
